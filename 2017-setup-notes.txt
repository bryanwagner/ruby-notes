Note: looks like I also need the devkit for MinGW's GCC (even though I already have MinGW)

First install bundler if you don't have it
  `gem install bundler` or `sudo gem install bundler`
if you don't have the required permissions. Bundler is a gem that manages gem dependencies.
then you can follow the above instruction for creating the gemfile, after which you can issue the command
  bundle install

Aptana_Studio_3_Setup_3.6.1 /passive /norestart
(I am unsure whether Aptana Studio will work properly without those "prerequisites", but it appears to.)
If you want a global installation in a specific directory, the command line is
Aptana_Studio_3_Setup_3.6.1.exe /passive /norestart ALLUSERS=1 APPDIR=c:\apps\AptanaStudio
